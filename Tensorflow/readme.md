# Tensorflow

This module covers the basic Tensorflow API, how to use it, it's not a reference, it's more like a guide to show you how and why to use tensorflow, so going over the API and showing you how to use every little peace of it, we don't do that here, at least not from the beginning, you will get introduced to the API through a jounery of small tutorials, demonstrating how you would use tenorflow for simple scenarios, na d moving on to more complex ones bit by bit, since this seems to be the most effective way to learn tensorflow.  

But at some point you also need to go deeper in understanding the API, like what are tensors, computation graphs, tf.functions, tf.variables, and more, so you can be more proficient at using tensorflow, this will also be covered some notebooks on its own, you may not need to read it at first, but at somepoint you will.  

Tensorflow is a machine learning library for numerical computation, it provides a high-level API for building complex models. it hides all the mathematical details behind its simple interface, but you should understand it well so as to see how everything fits together.

This module will contain multiple jupyter notebooks, demonstrating the basic usage of Tensorflow, we will also add a separate file for other Tensorflow related topics, resources, important tools, etc.
