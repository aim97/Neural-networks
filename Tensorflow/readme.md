# Tensorflow

This module covers the basic Tensorflow API, how to use it.  
Tensorflow is a machine learning library for numerical computation, it provides a high-level API for building complex models. it hides all the mathematical details behind its simple interface, but you should understand it well so as to see how everything fits together.

This module will contain multiple jupyter notebooks, demonstrating the basic usage of Tensorflow, we will also add a separate file for other Tensorflow related topics, resources, important tools, etc.

## Contents

### Basics

1. [X] [Sequential model - notebook](./Tensorflow-what-you-need-to-know.ipynb):  it covers the most basic use of Tensorflow, through the Sequential model.  
2. [X] [Functional API 1 - notebook](./FunctionalAPI-1.ipynb): it demonstrates the use of Tensorflow functional API, which can be used to build more complex models, it works on energy + effciency dataset.
3. [X] [Functional API 2 - notebook](./FunctionalAPI-2.ipynb): it demonstrates the use of Tensorflow functional API, which can be used to build more complex models.
